In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
We will determine if the first stage will land successfully, train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
The project is composed of the following modules:

1.Data collection is through api and web scraping.
We will be working with the endpoint api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past.
2.Data collection through web scraping
Python BeautifulSoup package to web scrape some HTML tables that contain Falcon 9 launch records.
